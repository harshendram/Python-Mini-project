## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes financial and employee satisfaction data from four different branches. Various statistical computations and visualizations are performed to extract key insights and trends. The project is designed for a **20-mark internal evaluation** as part of academic coursework.

## 🎯 Features
✅ Randomized dataset for branch revenue, expenses, and satisfaction ratings.  
✅ Categorization of branches based on annual revenue.  
✅ Calculation of net income, revenue projections, and high-revenue months.  
✅ Multiple data visualizations (line plots, bar charts, pie charts, scatter plots, and dashboards).  
✅ Data export to CSV for further analysis.

## 📊 Key Results & Insights
### 🔹 **Branch Categorization**
| Branch   | Annual Revenue | Category             |
|----------|--------------|----------------------|
| Branch A | $1,200,000   | Excellent            |
| Branch B | $800,000     | Good                 |
| Branch C | $950,000     | Good                 |
| Branch D | $450,000     | Needs Improvement    |

### 🔹 **Employee Satisfaction vs. Profit**
✅ Higher employee satisfaction correlates with higher profitability.  
✅ The best-performing branch had an employee satisfaction score of **4.8**.  
✅ Lower satisfaction was observed in underperforming branches.
